# Bookstore-Website

This whole project is designated to implement an online purchase system for both customers and employers at a bookstore. The website covers the functionalities of searching books, filtering books, looking up details, adding to books to cart and checking out for customers. And for employers and managers, they are able to change the account status of registered users and procure books when the stock is below the point.
